**JAVA BITCOIN LIBRARY**

This repository is a Java translation of the book *Programming Bitcoin* by Jimmy Song. It follows the structure and examples of the original Python code, reimplemented in Java for educational purposes.
It includes implementations of basic cryptographic primitives such as ECDSA, as well as a simple Bitcoin node capable of performing handshakes with other nodes.

**Note**: This project is not production-ready and should be used for learning and experimentation only


This is a personal learning project to help me better understand how Bitcoin works on a technical level such as cryptography, network protocols, and Bitcoin internals. I plan to gradually implement more complex functionality over time as I continue to explore the protocol in greater depth.
